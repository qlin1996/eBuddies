## Welcome to our eBuddies App! 

eBuddies is a mobile application designed to help a host create, customize and keep track of events, while allowing different users to participate in those events. You can think of eBuddies as an outlet that allows you to bring people from different backgrounds, but of the same interests, together. Our application allows everyone to create and/or participate in events, it also allows you to communicate with those that are part of that specific event.
